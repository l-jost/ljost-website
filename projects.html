                <h3>Vega Flight Computer</h3>
                <p class="project-meta">Control and Telemetry Systems Product</p>
                <p>Engineered a versatile flight computer addressing the need for reliable rocketry recovery hardware. Features automatic orientation detection and a configurable Finite State Machine managing flight phases and triggering user-defined events (pyro, servo, GPIO).</p>
                <img src="images/vega.avif" alt="Vega Flight Computer PCB for rocketry recovery" class="project-image">
                <h4>Engineering Highlights</h4>
                <p>Leverages an STM32 microcontroller with advanced Kalman Filter sensor fusion for precise tracking. Implements a custom, robust 2.4GHz FHSS telemetry system for secure, long-range (10km+ tested), high-rate (10Hz) data transmission. Includes high-power outputs, configurable servo control, comprehensive onboard data logging, and streamlined configuration via a custom Electron desktop application.</p>

                <h3>Ground Station</h3>
                <p class="project-meta">Control and Telemetry Systems Product</p>
                <p>Developed the companion hardware for the Vega flight computer, enabling real-time monitoring, tracking, and interaction during rocket flights.</p>
                <img src="images/ground-station.avif" alt="Custom ground station hardware with display and controls" class="project-image">
                <h4>Engineering Highlights</h4>
                <p>Features dual SX1280 radios supporting reception from two independent Vega units or diversity tracking of one. Incorporates a high-visibility transflective display, USB-C charging, onboard logging, and integrated compass/GNSS for enhanced tracking. Software enables remote event triggering for testing and immediate post-flight data review via an integrated plotter. Secure pairing with Vega units is managed via a simple "link phrase".</p>

                <h3>Parachute Reefing System for Sounding Rockets</h3>
                <p class="project-meta">Collaboration with ARIS</p>
                <p>To mitigate high shock loads during parachute deployment on increasingly large research rockets for ARIS, an active reefing system was engineered. This system controls the parachute's initial opening size, allowing for a gentler full deployment at a specific altitude.</p>
                 <img src="images/reefing-computer.jpg" alt="Custom PCB for parachute reefing system control" class="project-image">
               <h4>Engineering Highlights</h4>
                <p>The core mechanism involved precisely cutting a reefing line using a controlled ceramic heating element. Custom STM32-based hardware was developed to manage the heating element, process sensor data for altitude determination (using a Kalman Filter), and handle telemetry communication. Significant focus was placed on power management for long standby times in battery-operated scenarios.</p>

                <h3>Fleet Monitoring System</h3>
                <p class="project-meta">Collaboration with Onway AG</p>
                <p>Developed an IoT solution for Onway AG to enable real-time monitoring of public transport vehicle fleets. The system gathers low-level vehicle data directly from the CAN bus and transmits it to a cloud backend for analysis and issue detection.</p>
                 <img src="images/fleet-monitor.jpg" alt="ESP32-based IoT device for vehicle fleet monitoring" class="project-image">
                <h4>Engineering Highlights</h4>
                <p>Based on an ESP32-S2 SoC, the system features direct CAN bus interfacing, data filtering, and flexible data forwarding via Ethernet or Wi-Fi. An integrated accelerometer provides driving performance metrics. Robustness was enhanced with an onboard file system for configuration management, supporting updates via USB or Over-the-Air (OTA).</p>
