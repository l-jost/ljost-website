            <h4>Personal Company Project - 2020-2023</h4>
            <p>To recovery model rockets, a parachute needs to be
              ejected at the correct time. For this to happen a flight
              computer is needed to continuously read out altitude
              data and calculate the deployment point.
              Since no good recovery hardware is available on the
              market a new, redundant, and reliable computer needs
              to be developed.</p>

            <h4>Technology</h4>
            <p>Based around a STM32 microcontroller the software
              utilizes a Kalman Filter to fuse together sensor data to
              get accurate velocity and altitude information. Over a
              self-developed telemetry protocol, using FHSS and LoRa,
              data can be sent to the ground.
              High power output channels can switch valves or
              pyrotechnics. Additionally, servo motor channels were
              added to allow the user to set the device up as he likes.
              Over USB and with a Electron desktop application the
              user can easily change the device settings.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/BA-OST-22">Parachute Reefing System for Sounding Rockets</a></h2>
            <h4>Bachelor Thesis in collaboration with ARIS - 2022</h4>
            <p>The association Akademische Raumfahrt Initiative
              Schweiz (ARIS) brings together students from Swiss
              universities interested in space exploration. Several
              rockets have been built over the years for student
              competitions and research. The rockets built by ARIS
              are fully reusable, as they are recovered by parachute.
              With the rockets getting larger and heavier with each
              passing year, a solution to reduce the shock loads at
              parachute opening is needed. Consequently, the
              development of an active parachute reefing system was
              proposed.
            </p>
            <img class="image filter-white" src="images/reefing-iilustration.svg" alt="Reefing Iilustration">
            <h4>Technology</h4>
            <p>The reefing line is guided through a ceramic heating
              element and gets burned through at a target altitude.
              Once the reefing line is cut, the parachute can fully open.
              A custom hardware was developed to drive the heating
              element, receive data over a telemetry link and process
              sensor data. The system is based around a STM32
              microcontroller and a Kalman Filter was developed and
              deployed to estimate the rocket velocity and altitude.
              The system is battery operated and lasts for a few
              months in standby.

            <h4>Semester Thesis in collaboration with Onway AG - 2021</h4>
            <p>The company Onway AG is interested in providing an
              elegant solution for public transport fleets (e.g. buses)
              to gather low-level vehicle data and transmit them to a
              cloud-based system. This information can then be used
              to monitor the state of the vehicle and inform about
              possible issues in real-time.

            <p class="image-desc">Renderings of the Fleet Monitoring System</p>
            <h4>Technology</h4>
            <p>The system is based around an ESP32-S2 system on
              chip. The device connects directly to the CAN-Bus,
              collects and filters incoming data, and forwards it to a
              host device over Ethernet or WiFi. Additionally, an
              accelerometer was added to monitor information about
              the driving performance.
              A file system was implemented to easily access the
              configuration. The configuration can be uploaded via the
              USB port or over the air.
