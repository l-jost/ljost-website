            <p>
              In order to successfully recover model rockets, precise timing 
              is essential for the ejection of a parachute. Achieving this 
              requires the utilization of a flight computer, which continually 
              monitors altitude data and computes the optimal deployment moment. 
              Given the absence of suitable recovery hardware in the current 
              market, there is a pressing need to innovate and create a new, 
              redundant, and dependable computer system for this purpose.</p>

            <p class="image-desc">Rendering of the CATS Vega flight computer</p>
            <h4>Technology</h4>
            <p>Built around an STM32 microcontroller, the software leverages 
              a sophisticated Kalman Filter to integrate sensor data, ensuring 
              precise and reliable velocity and altitude measurements. Employing 
              a self-developed telemetry protocol that combines Frequency-Hopping 
              Spread Spectrum (FHSS) and LoRa technology, telemetry data can 
              efficiently be transmitted to a ground station. Moreover, the system 
              boasts high-power output channels capable of controlling valves or 
              pyrotechnic devices. To further enhance user customization, it
              incorporated servo motor channels, allowing users to configure 
              the device to their preferences. Streamlining the user experience, 
              adjustments to device settings can be effortlessly made via USB 
              connection in a user-friendly Electron desktop application.</p>

            <h4>Bachelor Thesis in collaboration with ARIS - 2022</h4>
            <p>The association Akademische Raumfahrt Initiative
              Schweiz (ARIS) brings together students from Swiss
              universities interested in space exploration. Several
              rockets have been built over the years for student
              competitions and research. The rockets built by ARIS
              are fully reusable, as they are recovered by parachute.
              With the rockets getting larger and heavier with each
              passing year, a solution to reduce the shock loads at
              parachute opening is needed. Consequently, the
              development of an active parachute reefing system was
              proposed.
            </p>
            <img class="image filter-white" src="images/reefing-iilustration.svg" alt="Reefing Iilustration">
            <h4>Technology</h4>
            <p>The reefing line is guided through a ceramic heating
              element and gets burned through at a target altitude.
              Once the reefing line is cut, the parachute can fully open.
              A custom hardware was developed to drive the heating
              element, receive data over a telemetry link and process
              sensor data. The system is based around a STM32
              microcontroller and a Kalman Filter was developed and
              deployed to estimate the rocket velocity and altitude.
              The system is battery operated and lasts for a few
              months in standby.

            <h4>Semester Thesis in collaboration with Onway AG - 2021</h4>
            <p>The company Onway AG is interested in providing an
              elegant solution for public transport fleets (e.g. buses)
              to gather low-level vehicle data and transmit them to a
              cloud-based system. This information can then be used
              to monitor the state of the vehicle and inform about
              possible issues in real-time.

            <p class="image-desc">Renderings of the Fleet Monitoring System</p>
            <h4>Technology</h4>
            <p>The system is based around an ESP32-S2 system on
              chip. The device connects directly to the CAN-Bus,
              collects and filters incoming data, and forwards it to a
              host device over Ethernet or WiFi. Additionally, an
              accelerometer was added to monitor information about
              the driving performance.
              A file system was implemented to easily access the
              configuration. The configuration can be uploaded via the
              USB port or over the air.
