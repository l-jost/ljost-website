            <h3>Core Expertise</h3>
            <p>My expertise spans the full lifecycle of embedded systems development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hardware Design:</strong> I'm proficient in designing complex, mixed-signal PCBs for demanding applications using tools like Altium Designer. My experience covers microcontrollers (STM32), sensors, RF communication, power management, and high-power circuitry.</li>
                <li><strong>Firmware Engineering:</strong> I develop robust and efficient firmware in C/C++ for bare-metal and RTOS environments (like STM32). My expertise includes low-level drivers (I2C, SPI, UART, CAN, LIN), control algorithms, sensor fusion (Kalman filters), and adhering to standards like MISRA/AUTOSAR.</li>
                <li><strong>System Engineering:</strong> Experienced in requirement engineering, system architecture, testing, and validation, particularly within the aerospace and automotive sectors.</li>
                <li><strong>Prototyping &amp; Manufacturing:</strong> Capable of managing the transition from design to production, including component sourcing and small-batch manufacturing coordination.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Industry Experience Highlights</h3>
            <p>I've had the opportunity to contribute to and lead projects across various demanding industries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aerospace (Rocket Lab, ARIS ETH Zurich):</strong> I led avionics teams, designed safety-critical hardware with redundancy, developed power subsystems for launch vehicles, and implemented flight control firmware.</li>
                <li><strong>Automotive &amp; Industrial (Sensirion):</strong> I developed hardware and firmware for automotive sensors (LIN, Cortex-M0+), adhering to MISRA/AUTOSAR standards, and contributed to CI/CD processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Consultancy (Control and Telemetry Systems GmbH):</strong> I co-founded this company, based in Switzerland. Here, I specialize in designing hardware and firmware for diverse applications (often using RTOS on STM32) and manage small-batch production. By leveraging a remote engineering approach, I deliver cost-optimized solutions while maintaining seamless communication and the high-quality standards synonymous with Swiss engineering.</li>
                <li><strong>Research &amp; Development (IWK HSR):</strong> I designed flight computer hardware and firmware for fixed-wing UAVs, including PID stabilization and image processing algorithms (OpenCV/Python).</li>
            </ul>
