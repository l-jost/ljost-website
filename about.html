                <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Picture of Luca Jost, founder of Control and Telemetry Systems" class="about-founder-image" data-translate="about.founder.img.alt">
                <p data-translate="about.founder.p1">Welcome! I'm Luca Jost, the founder of Control and Telemetry Systems. My passion for electronics and technology drives everything I do here. My journey has been one of continuous learning and hands-on project work.</p>
                <p data-translate="about.founder.p2">My journey in engineering has taken me across the globe. After gaining valuable experience at Sensirion in Switzerland, I moved to New Zealand to contribute to the exciting field of space exploration at Rocket Lab. Now based in South Korea, my core passions remain space and electronics, and I thrive on the challenge of developing innovative solutions.</p>
                <p data-translate="about.founder.p3">Control and Telemetry Systems began as a hobby project five years ago, initially focused on building a fully customizable open-source flight computer, named Vega, for amateur rockets designed to reach altitudes up to 30 kilometers. Since its inception, Vega has achieved remarkable success.</p>
                <p data-translate="about.founder.p4">To date, Vega flight computers have flown successfully hundreds of times and have been supplied to people worldwide. Notably, Vega was selected as the official tracking and logging system for the biggest rocketry challenge in Europe (EuRoC) since 2023.</p>
                <p data-translate="about.founder.p5">EuRoC, held annually in Portugal, brings together 25 student teams from across Europe to compete. Every rocket launched at EuRoC is equipped with a Vega flight computer, ensuring standardized apogee reporting and reliable rocket tracking. Teams also utilize Vega's capabilities to implement mechanisms like airbrakes for precise altitude control.</p>
